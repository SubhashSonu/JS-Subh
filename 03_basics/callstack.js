/* Javascript Execution Context
  {} -> Global Execution context 
   -> Function Execution context
   -> Eval execution contest


   {} -> Memory creation Phase
      -> Execution Phase

      let val1 = 10 
      let val2 =5
      function addNum(num1, num2){
        let total = num1 +num2
        return total
      }

      let result1 = addNum(val1, val2)
      let result2 = addNum(10, 2)


🔵The working of the JavaScript works on three phases:
1. Global Execution Context
2. Memory phase / Creation phase
3. Execution phase

🔵Phase 1: Global Execution Context
The value of `this` keyword is set to Global Execution Context (which is an empty Object in NODE environment, & window object in browser environment)

🔵Phase 2: Memory phase
During this phase, JS engine scans the code and assigns the initial values for the variables , functions, etc.. For variables they are 'undefined' and for functions they are set to their function definition

🔵Phase 3: Execution phase
After the creation phase completed, the execution phase begins where actual values of the variables are set. And when the functions are called it creates a new 'Function Execution' context which consists of two phases (they works same as explained above but only for the particular function scope):
1. Memory phase 
2. Execution phase 
📝The return value of the 'Function Execution' context is passed to the Global Execution Context
